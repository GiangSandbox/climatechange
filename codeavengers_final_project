                    <h3>What's Climate Change?</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">Climate change is a process which causes long-term changes in temperature and weather
                      patterns. It is putting not just ours, but also the animals' and plants' lives at danger by
                      trapping the heat from the sun and increasing its temperature.
                      Greenhouse gas emissions like Carbon dioxide and methane are the main
                      culprits of climate change, which can be found in a lot of human activities. Ever since
                      the industrial revolution, the temperature has been rising more quickly than ever before.
                      According to an UN report in 2018, Earth is now 1.1°C higher than it was back in the
                      late 1800s and would rise to 2.7°C by the end of the century.</p>

                    <h3>Why did it Happens?</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">Originally, climate change was only a natural thing, which could only cause small
                      changes in warming. But ever since the industrial revolution, humans have put their
                      hands into climate change, causing it to make more drastic changes. The main reason
                      of climate change process consists of:
                      <ul>
                      <li> Transportation (produces massive amounts of COz from burned petroleum-based
                      fuel)</li>
                      <li> Deforestation (Releasing CO2 stored in vegetation and soil annually)</li>
                      <li> Oil & Gas Development (leaks methane out from the operations)</li>
                      <li> Commodity Production (produces things like cement, iron, steel, electricity,</li>
                      plastic, and clothing are made by burning fossil fuels to create energy, which
                      create emissions)
                      <li> Excessive consumption (Our activities contribute to greenhouse gas emissions,
                      like how you use electricity, how you eat, throw away, what you wear, etc.)</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Consequences</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">All causes have consequences, and the consequences to climate change have
                      brought us multiple threats.</p>
                    <p>The temperature will rise from greenhouse gases. With high temperatures, it
                      can increase heat-related illnesses, difficulty of outdoor activities, and a higher chance
                      of quick-spread wildfires.
                      Global warming heat is mostly absorbed by the ocean. This causes coastal
                      and island communities to melt ice sheets, raise sea levels, and increase ocean acidity,
                      endangering marine life. This has been affecting islands or seaside places like Venice,
                      Italy, which has been at risk of sinking.
                      Heat also evaporates water, causing prolonged droughts. Sand and dust
                      storms, desert expansion, and food scarcity are caused, threatening people's daily
                      water needs and their crops.
                      Other than causing droughts, heat can also cause more intense storms.
                      Leads to severe storms, flooding, and landslides, destroying buildings, houses, and
                      communities, which brings both loss of life and economic loss.
                      Factors that leave people in poverty increase. All the natural disasters have
                      an effect on them, like how flooding sweeps away homes and livelihoods, droughts and
                      water scarcity affect crops, heat causes difficulty in outdoor activities, and more. These
                      disasters displace 23.1 million people in the last decades, leaving many more
                      vulnerable to poverty.</p>

                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      <ul>
                      <li> Human activities have warmed the atmosphere, oceans, and land, causing rapid
                      and widespread changes to the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere and biosphere.</li>
                      <li> The scale of recent changes in the climate system has been unprecedented for
                      centuries, even thousands of years. Many changes are irreversible over
                      centuries or even millennia, especially in oceans, ice caps and global sea levels.</li>
                      <li> Man-made climate change affects all regions. There is growing evidence of a link
                      with extreme heat waves, heavy rainfall, droughts, and tropical storms.</li>
                      <li> Global surface temperatures will continue to rise until at least mid-centurv. Unless
                      we make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades, if
                      global warming exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius, then the climate consequences will
                      be even more severe.</li>
                      <li> The hotter the world, the more changes the climate system will have. This
                      includes more frequent and extreme temperature events, heat waves at sea,
                      heavy rainfall, agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions, rates of
                      intense tropical cyclones, and Arctic Sea ice reduction, snow cover and
                      permafrost.</li>
                      <li> Continued global warming will further enhance the global water cycle, making it
                      more variable and altering monsoon rainfall and severity of dry and wet events.</li>
                      <li> As carbon dioxide emissions increase, oceans and land become less efficient at
                      absorbing and slowing the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</li>
                      <li> With global warming continuing, every region will experience more and more
                      changes in the drivers of climate impacts. Conductors will be more common at 2
                      degrees Celsius than at 1.5 degrees Celsius, and even more so at higher levels
                      of warming.</li>
                      <li> The collapse of the ice sheets, sudden changes in ocean circulation, and warming
                      beyond currently anticipated are outcomes that are less likely but cannot be ruled
                      out.</li>
                      <li> Limiting anthropogenic global warming requires limiting cumulative carbon
                      dioxide emissions to at least zero. There is also a need to deeply reduce
                      emissions of other greenhouse gases such as methane.</li>
                      <li> Achieving low or very low greenhouse gas emissions will have a significant
                      impact on greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations as well as air quality
                      within a few years. Notable differences in global surface temperatures will appear
                      in about 20 years.</li>

                    <h3>What happen in COP27?</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic"> The UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) took place from 6 - 20 November
                      2022 in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt and ended with a breakthrough agreement on a
                      new loss and damage fund for vulnerable countries. </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic">Here is a 10-minute summary of some of the conference's highlights.
                      The UNFCCC secretariat (UN Climate Change) is the United Nations entity tasked
                      with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. UNFCCC
                      stands for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The
                      Convention has near universal membership (197 Parties) and is the parent treaty of
                      the 2015 Paris Agreement. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep the
                      global average temperature rise this century as close as possible to 1.5 degrees
                      Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the
                      1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all three agreements under the
                      UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level
                      that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time
                      frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable
                      development.

              <span>Vietnam </span>is one of the fast-growing economies in Asia, which is going through a far-reaching transformation from an inward-looking plan to one that is globalised and market based. Over the last 25 years, with the policy of “đổi mới” (renovation or new changes), Vietnam has transitioned from an extremely poor country to a lower-middle-income country in less than two decades. Vietnam’s goal is to build solid foundations as an industrialised country by 2020. However, after policies in rural development and poverty reduction, there is still a barrier for Vietnam in the path to become a strongly developing country, which is – Climate change. <br/>
              </p>
              <p>
              The sixth-most severely impacted nation by climate change is Viet Nam, where erratic weather patterns have killed people, destroyed infrastructure, and impacted vulnerable communities. The threat to children's access to food, water, education, and healthcare has a significant impact. Urbanisation makes people more exposed, and women are affected disproportionately. By 2050, the Mekong Delta and lowland areas will be affected by droughts, more precipitation, and rising sea levels as a result of global warming. As a result, there will be a decrease in labour productivity, crop yields, natural resource degradation, and loss of assets.<br/>
              By strengthening partnerships, enlisting financial support, stabilising the macroeconomic environment, assisting the post-COVID-19 recovery, and making investments in human capital, innovation, and digitization, Vietnam hopes to maintain the current pace and quicken the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It is essential to step up initiatives to stabilise the macroeconomy and move toward a green and circular economy. In order to achieve the SDGs for vulnerable groups, especially the poor and racial minorities, inclusive growth and improved transparency and accountability are crucial.<br/>
              </p>
              <p>
              As for now, Vietnam is facing two important difficulties. Firstly, Vietnam needs $400 billion from now to 2040 to effectively respond to climate change, according to the Climate Change Department. The State budget can only cover $130 billion, making it a significant financial challenge. Secondly, interstate management, poor water quality, scarcity, and natural disasters are a few of the difficulties Viet Nam faces with regard to water security. Luckily, the government had made a move to fix the issue. To address these issues, UNESCO, IMHEN, and IHP organised a national workshop. More than 40 participants presented case studies on IWRM, water-sharing agreements, climate change, and water resource management in the Ba River basin while discussing the need for water management, particularly in riverine deltas. Interdisciplinary recommendations for Vietnam's effective water security were provided by the workshop.

                At the COP26 climate conference, Vietnam joined the pledge to reduce global methane emissions in 2030 compared to 2010, and made a 
                commitment to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century. The international community has highly appreciated Vietnam's strong promises and responsible efforts, which have created new prospects for collaboration on low-emission growth, the promotion of the circular economy, and climate change adaptation. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Phạm Văn Tân - Deputy Director of the Department for Climate Change, said in order to fulfill Vietnam’s commitments at COP26, the Government will soon introduce regulations on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting the ozone layer, the national system to track and evaluate efforts to adapt to climate change, a list of the industries and greenhouse gas emitting facilities that must track their emissions, and a strategy for developing Vietnam's carbon market.
              </p>
              <p>
                By 2050 Vietnam expects:
                <ul>
                    <li>Energy sector emissions will be reduced by 91.6%, and capped at 101 million mtCO2e</li>
                    <li>Agriculture sector emissions will be cut by 63.1%, and capped at 56 million mtCO2e</li>
                    <li>Foresty sector and land use emissions cut by 90%, increase carbon sequestration by 30%, with total emissions and removals reaching at least negative 185 million mtCO2e</li>
                    <li>Waste sector emissions cut by 90.7%, and capped at 8 million mtCO2e</li>
                    <li>Industrial process emissions cut by 84.8%, and capped at 20 million mtCO2e</li>

                    As for now, Vietnam is facing a difficulty. Vietnam needs $400 billion from now to 2040 to effectively respond to climate change, according to the Climate Change Department. The State budget can only cover $130 billion, making it a significant financial challenge. To achieve net zero emissions, Vietnam should prioritize investment in infrastructure, improve forecasting, and engage businesses in green 
                    transformation, low-carbon technology, and energy efficiency projects. Strengthening international cooperation and mobilizing resources from bilateral and multilateral ties is also crucial. In addition, Vietnam is also trying to stop stop rice warming the planet. Rice, Asia’s principal staple, is to blame for around 10 percent of global emissions of methane, a gas that over two decades traps around 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide. As one of the world’s biggest rice producer, Vietnam’s government is also trying to stop rice production from making worse effect on climate change.

                    <h3>A CALL TO ACTION</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">As a student, I believe addressing climate change in Vietnam should consider the country's geography and economy. Below are some solutions I’m thinking of that can be proposed by both the government and citizens, to make a bigger change:
                      <ol type="1">
                        <li>Mangrove Conservation and Rehabilitation Vietnam's coastline is around 3,260 kilometers long, making it vulnerable to sea level rise, storm surges, and other climate-related events. Mangroves are a natural coastal protection system that can help minimize the impact of these events. This method should work for the conservation and rehabilitation of mangrove forests along the coast to strengthen the country's resilience to 
                      climate change.

                      </li>  
                      
                        <li>Promoting Sustainable Tourism Tourism is a significant contributor to Vietnam's economy. However, its growth has led to environmental degradation, particularly in natural and heritage sites. As a student, one can promote sustainable tourism practices that help reduce the industry's environmental impact. This can include educating tourists on responsible behavior, encouraging the use of eco-friendly transport, and promoting local economies that support environmental conservation efforts.</li>
                      
                        <li>
                          
                          Using renewable energy Vietnam's energy production is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, mainly coal. The nation is well-positioned to meet its soaring energy needs through alternative power because it has sufficient and easily accessible renewable sources. By promoting the adoption of renewable 
                          energy sources, such as solar and wind power, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the country.

As a student, I can advocate for reducing plastic use and proper waste management practices to minimize environmental pollution</li> 
                      </ol>
                      In conclusion, addressing climate change in Vietnam I believe it requires considering the country's geography and economy and every citizen to have sense of cooperation as well as awareness to climate change. Solutions such as mangrove conservation, promoting sustainable tourism, adoption of renewable energy sources, and reducing plastic waste can help improve the country's environmental resilience and mitigate the impact of climate-related events.

                    <h3>ACT NOW FOR A BETTER VIETNAM</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">
                      From the beginning of 2022 until now, climate change has been warned by scientists to reach a serious level, causing extremely bad effects on humanity if we continue to destroy the environment. Ever since then, I have been following the ten actions of ActNow that the UN has given to us. After some time, I have realised that me alone working in changing my lifestyle wouldn't do much, so I believe that you guys should change the ways you live too. Here are some solutions I believe we all should do:
                      <h4>STOP LITTERING THE NATURE</h4>
                        One day, I was kayaking with my mother in Hạ Long Bay. The water was clear and there were small fishes swimming around. It was beautiful, but afterwards, we came across an ocean of garbage which destroyed the view. Ha Long bay itself was recognised by UNESCO as a World Natural Heritage, and now, some parts of Ha Long Bay are polluted by boats and ships.
                      <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">What could happen?</h5>
                        Trashing in wrong areas, especially water surface, contributes to worsening climate change, as they can contain or mix toxic chemicals that make up greenhouse gases. Water in Vietnam is so polluted that it causes almost 80% of the diseases, which contains typhoid, cholera, dysentery and malaria. 
                                            
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">What should we do?</h5>
                        I know that we all enjoy nature, and I’m sure you would want nature to stay beautiful too. If we would stop littering into the ocean, the amount of sea mammals would increase, which benefits the food chain as well as fishermen who live their life selling seafood, and less people will have to get diseases from unclean water. Vietnam’s length of coastline is more than 3000 km from north to south, and if we clear out the coastline litter and trash, the ocean will look more beautiful and paradise-like, attracting people from the world to travel to Vietnam and enjoy its beauty, which also improves the country’s economy. Together, we can become warriors who protect the environment from trash and litter to restore the beauty our world was gifted to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <h4>REDUCE FAST FASHION</h4>
                      I love fashion, and I’m sure most people would want to look good too. But little did we know, the process of making clothes also contributes to climate change. 
                      
                      <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">What does it do?</h5>
                      A lot of toxic chemicals are used during the process of making clothes, especially when using cloth dye, because that also contributes to producing greenhouse gases, producing about 10% of annual global carbon emissions, which in the future, might exceed over 50%. And it's all because of using fast fashion. The fashion industry wanted to chase the trends, so they chose fast fashion to produce them quickly at a cheap price, but fast fashion uses fabric material like polyester, which was made out of small strings of plastic, which all the process of making plastic creates greenhouse gases. 
                      <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">What should we wear instead?</h5>  
                      We must reduce the amount of producing and using fast fashion clothes, but then, what are we going to wear now? We can switch to sustainable fashion, use natural cloth dye from flowers, plants or fruit and wear fabrics such as silk, alpaca, and more. That way, we can both benefit the environment, and our health as well (especially silk), since they are naturally absorbent, which makes them breathable and comfortable, this helps our skin stay dry and prevents irritation or allergies. Vietnam stands in 5th place when it comes to silk-making, which also benefits the traditional handcraft villages that are focused on silk-making, lifting them out of poverty and increasing the country’s economy as well as tradition. The world follows trends, and sustainability is becoming one, so why not move to sustainable fashion?

                      <h4>HARMONY WITH NATURE</h4>
                      I want to become an architectural designer when I grow up. I had the idea of designing a smart tech city where people can live with nature which uses renewable energy and electricity transportations to run the city instead of fossil fuels and more.
                      
                      <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Ecosystem-based adaptation</h5>
                       People have been trying to cope with the climate change issues with stuff that is either very expensive or would just worsen the issue. Take temperature rising for example, people would just stay inside and cool their house down with air conditioning (which uses a lot of fossil fuels), or people would spend money on building barriers to prevent the coastal floodings, even though they could also use another method called ecosystem-based adaptation, where we could plant trees and make a pond to cool the temperature down, and use mangrove forests or coral reefs to weaken the waves that attacks the city. We could use this not just for preventing the world from warming up, but also to help them cool down because plants can absorb Carbon Dioxide.
                      

                       <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Living green</h5>
                        From my perspective, harmony with nature is living with its features and geography, whether it's a landscape, forest, mountain, coastline, … My city’s structure will be based on nature, geography, natural factors (land, climate) and culture of the area where the city will be built on, so that even though our city is a smart city, it will still illustrate and keep the gifted beauty of Vietnam in that area, and not removing it out of sight to make the city look “futuristic”. Nature benefits us a lot, it gives us calmness, reduces stress, improves our mood, helps us concentrate, solve problems, and keeps us healthy, rather than stressing out from the annoying traffic sounds or having to breath poor air quality.
                        <br clear="all"/>
                      <div class="image-holder-article-left">
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GiangSandbox/climatechange/main/img/tra-my/tra-my-living-green.jpg?raw=true" 
                          width="560px">

                      <br clear="all"/>
                      
                      
                        In the end, if you want to change something, you have to act quickly. The problem has already worsened and is challenging Vietnam with alot of climate change issues, but it is not too late for us to act and change our fate, and it is by changing our lifestyles as our way of living also contributes to quickening the process of climate change. If we don’t protect nature, then we can’t protect ourselves, so together, let's put fate into our hands and change it for a better Vietnam.

                    <span style="margin-left: 25px;"> That </span>is not just a dream, but a goal, a future is aiming for: a verdant hue, a lovely clean earth, a nice air entering your lungs, an air without harmful fumes, without the scorching sun's rays, but an ambient blue everywhere you walk. None of us prefers to breathe in smoke emanating from the factory every single time they go outside, emissions burning garbage, or trapped among the sea of people and vehicles, sirens blaring across the road. No one enjoys living in a flood situation, business is sluggish, another individual goes missing, or catastrophic weather conditions occur.
                    
                    <div>But what we humans don't want is occurring right now, every minute of every second; just a few minutes ago, a baby in Yen Bai was washed away, and a 9-year-old in Van Yen was also terrified when a storm followed by flooding took his life.

                    <span>A row of cars became stranded in Hanoi's Soc Son area. Vietnam is one of the top five countries in the world in terms of vulnerability to climate change, thus the key issue now is... how to overcome, to tackle climate change, catastrophic weather?</span>
                    <span>	As it is known that climate change is caused by vehicles that emit greenhouse gases, with science now, many people have changed to electric cars instead of using petrol cars, switching to walking, driving. cycling to promote health as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</span>

                    
                    
                    <span>Getting rid of coal burning is a challenging problem to address today since there are so many common commodities manufactured from this fuel that are used for both people mobility and cargo transportation. According to the International Energy Agency, coal is also the substrate that provides a source of electrical energy consumed globally. But it is also a highly dangerous adversary for the environment, and owing to research, many individuals have accepted other safer environmental solutions wherever feasible. For instance, utilising biodiesel, wind energy, solar energy, and so on. Plastic is created from oil, and the extraction and refining processes transform the oil into a shockingly high-carbon plastic. Because plastic takes a long time to degrade in nature, many people burn it, resulting in the release of hazardous pollutants. Plastics use is anticipated to expand so quickly that generation and disposal of plastics will account for 17% of the global carbon budget by 2050. So, what is the answer to this problem? That is, we must limit our usage of plastic in order to reduce waste while prioritising plastic recycling. Furthermore, please give precedence to items created from alternative materials that decompose quickly to replace plastic. While breeders talk a lot about vitamins, protein, fat, ... in meat, fish, shrimp that we use every day. It is also apparent that they are all essential nutrients for the body. However, this is only true if we consume the proper quantity. That implies you may drastically cut your daily meat and fish consumption while remaining fully healthy. Above all, in terms of environmental considerations, the cattle business emits hazardous gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. Eating a lot of veggies is also a wonderful solution!~ Make your house or room more private by having soundproof and insulated doors, which may cut your heating and cooling expenditures by more than 25%. Simply setting the high temperature to 2 degrees higher in winter and lower than 2 degrees in summer may save around 2 tonnes of CO2 each year.

                    </span>
                    <span>With the current school age, if I can contribute to climate change, I will change myself from everyday things such as throwing trash in the right place, recycling unwanted items, limit the use of plastic bags, plastic waste, plant green trees, limit the use of air conditioners and heaters, turn off the power when not in use because a large part of electricity comes from the burning of buildings. fossil fuels, environmental protection propaganda, participating in movements, not using products from wild animals, ... If expanded further, I want to contribute more than that. I'll ask the government to make stricter laws to protect forests, protect the sea, and government incentives to reduce emissions. The government can use a number of incentives to influence the conduct of individuals (and organisations). Carbon pricing, such as a carbon tax, mandates businesses and individuals to pay taxes for their carbon footprint. Individuals may be induced to switch to electric automobiles via tax breaks. Participate in school or community environmental groups or organisations that encourage conservation, recycling, and long-term sustainability. Local eco-friendly projects, such as tree planting, cleaning, and anti-single-use plastics campaigns, should be promoted. If such a group or organisation does not already exist, consider creating one to engage your coworkers in the battle against climate change.</span>
                    <span>That is why I aspire to be an AI scientist (Artificial Intelligence). I want to contribute more parts like water purifier, AI (reaction - basic type) to find out which vegetables are suitable to grow in this environment, and program a website to measure pollution index from there, which can offer the most suitable solutions. Most people will rush to the store to buy air conditioners and refrigerators when the temperature is 40 degrees Celsius or higher than usual in order to escape the heat. However, because these appliances use electricity which is made from coal to operate and also produce heat which also affects the environment , increasing temperature differences not only doesn't help anything, but also accelerates climate change. In order to keep the water clean while still having a cooling effect similar to an air conditioner, happy in 24 °C, I want to create a system to cool the water from which it travels throughout the city. I want to use artificial intelligence (AI) computer science to develop a virtual Vietnam, mimic it, and then green the buildings in that virtual Vietnam which is metaverse ( a concept defined by Facebook, it is a virtual world that people can experience in many different roles like the real world. Here each person, object, or thing can be an incarnation in separate virtual spaces and worlds, and can play different roles in many different spaces ) to turn the land green, more environmentally friendly water and then giving people real experience, bringing it to the state government and requesting for the construction of the country, because growing trees helps with flood resistance and absorbs less sunlight than concrete as well as capable of purifying the air, and further is the planting of plants that can not only be planted in the ground but can also be grown on high, many plants including vines are still able to reach over the high buildings to the blue sky. I'll utilise artificial intelligence to gauge environmental pollution levels so I can develop effective responses, as well as to detect storm, flood, and landslip warning signals so I can alert everyone in the nation to prepare mentally and physically in order to reduce the amount of missing persons and fatalities brought on by extreme weather occurrences.</span>

                      <span>When my mom was little, my grandma used to make a new woolen sweater for her to wear throughout the holiday season every Lunar New Year.</span><br/>

                      <span>As I grew older, my grandmother stitched a cotton jacket for me instead of knitting it for me. She was overjoyed to have found a great piece of natural cotton fabric to sew this jacket out of. The pastel pink jacket was embellished with lovely cherry blossom motifs and was light yet snug to wear. It completely captivated me.</span><br/>

                      <span>On New Year's Eve, my grandma worked up all night stitching this cotton jacket so that I would have new clothing to wear on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The weather was cold, with a little drizzle, typical of Hanoi's Tet vibe. Even though it was bitterly cold, I felt warm and comfy in my grandmother's cotton jacket.</span><br/>

                      <span>However, Hanoi's Lunar New Year has been increasingly warm in recent years, virtually identical to summer. I can't wear a cotton shirt anymore. It was carefully tucked away towards the base of the cabinet.</span><br/>

                      <span>Even the traditional Tet delicacy, bánh chưng (square sticky rice cake), is more likely to decay due to Hanoi's rising heat…</span><br/>

                      <h4>Small Changes to Make Big Differences</h4>

                      A slew of heartbreaking news has reached us in recent days: landslides causing a series of cars to sink into mud right in Sóc Sơn, Hanoi; soil erosion in Tây Nguyên, where deforestation is rampant; floods in Hanoi; flash floods in the northern mountainous region; and even the heartbreaking story of an elephant in chains...<br/>
                      
                      These stories have left us contemplating and feeling compassion for the land, the trees, the forests, the elephants, and our fellow humans. Humans cannot continue to put themselves at the center and abuse everything around them for their own profit indefinitely. We are merely a speck in the vast and enlightened natural world...<br/>
                      
                      In the face of escalating global climate change, Vietnam has embarked on a journey to combat its environmental challenges, demonstrating that even modest actions can lead to profound impacts.<br/>
                      
                      Vietnam, with its diverse landscapes and rich culture, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Rising sea levels, increased temperatures, and unpredictable weather patterns have already begun to threaten the livelihoods of millions. However, the nation has risen to the occasion by implementing a series of small but impactful changes to pave the way for a more sustainable future.<br/>
                      
                      One such change revolves around energy consumption. Traditional sources of energy, such as coal, have long contributed to greenhouse gas emissions. Recognizing the urgency, Vietnam has shifted its focus towards renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. Initiatives to install solar panels on rooftops and harness wind energy along the coastlines have gained momentum, gradually reducing the nation's carbon footprint.<br/>

                          width="300px">

                          My mother and her coworkers are working on a project to construct urban railway lines in Hanoi.
                        </div>
                      </div>
                      Transportation, another significant contributor to emissions, has also undergone a transformation. The introduction of electric buses in urban centers, urban rail systems, and the promotion of cycling and walking have not only reduced air pollution but also encouraged healthier lifestyles.<br/>
                      
                      <span>In rural areas, changes are equally evident. Agroforestry, which combines agricultural practices with tree planting, helps restore degraded lands while enhancing biodiversity. Farmers are adopting sustainable techniques, including organic farming and efficient irrigation systems, to safeguard their crops and conserve water resources.
                      Education is crucial to this paradigm shift. Schools throughout Vietnam and numerous other organizations are incorporating climate change and environmental conservation into their curricula, ensuring that the next generation will have a profound understanding of the significance of sustainability.
                      </span>

                      
                      

                        Furthermore, community-driven initiatives have emerged, rallying citizens to participate actively in waste reduction and recycling campaigns. Coastal clean-up events have become a regular occurrence, highlighting the significance of marine preservation.

                        These seemingly small changes, when woven together, have created a tapestry of resilience and progress. Vietnam's commitment to addressing climate change showcases how collective efforts can lead to meaningful transformations. As the nation continues on this path, it serves as an inspiring example for others, proving that by making mindful choices today, we can safeguard the planet for generations to come.

                     <span> Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to start right now. While a growing coalition of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, about half of emissions cuts must be in place by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C. Fossil fuel production must decline by roughly 6 percent per year between 2020 and 2030
